African Gray Parrot:African Gray Parrot, Psittacus erithacus. The African Gray Parrot is the largest of the African parrots and is the greatest talking parrot. The color is sooty gray with a pale gray rump, bright red tail, a black bill, and a white area around the yellow eye. The parrot's bill is highly adaptable. In addition to crushing nuts and preening, it serves as a third foot when moving about treetops. The feet are unique, in that the two outer toes point backward in opposition to the two inner toes, which point forward (zygodactilous). This enables them to manipulate objects, resulting in a manual dexterity that is unsurpassed in any other group of birds. They have even shown a tendency to be right-footed or left-footed, favoring one or the other when handling food.

African Lion:African Lion, Panthera Leo. The lion is the most distinctive of the big cats. Its coat is a tawny color, which provides good camouflage. At about age 1, males begin to develop a mane. When fully developed it is a great ruff, which ranges in color from tawny yellow to dark brown as he ages. The lion is the only big cat with a tassel (or tuft) of dark hair at the end of its tail. They are also the only cat to exhibit strong sexual dimorphism which is the occurrence of two distinct forms in the same species when the sexes differ in secondary as well as primary sexual characteristics.  The lion has earned the title "King of the Beasts" perhaps because few, if any, sounds in the animal kingdom are as frightening as the lion's roar. Or, perhaps it is because the long heavy mane simply looks regal. They are the second largest of the big cats. The lion reaches maturity (full growth) at about age 5 to 6. The female is somewhat smaller than the male. The Asiatic lion tends to be a little smaller, a little blonder, and perhaps has a scantier mane and a longer tail tuft. They have the largest brain of the big cats. Lions often sleep 20 or more hours per day.

Amur Tiger:Amur Tiger, Panthera Tigris Altaica. Amur tigers live in a harsh environment, where extremely cold temperatures and deep snow are common. They are larger than other cats so they can produce more heat in the cold climates. They have thicker fur for insulation and their bodies are well adapted to the cold climate. They also have a layer of fat on their flanks and bellies which helps protect them from the elements. Like most tigers they have a ruff of fur around their necks. This is more developed in Amur tigers and they have extra fur on their paws to protect them from the cold. Coat is golden orange with dark stripes, with all cats' markings being different and distinctive like fingerprints. They also have some patches of white on their bellies, chests, throats and muzzles. Amur tigers have more white and fewer stripes than others. Colors help it hide in its environment: white is like snow, black like shadows and yellow like dead oak leaves.  Spoors (footprints) of a male are rounded and impressions of toe pads in front are blunter; females' are elongated and toe pads are narrower and sharper shaped. They also have excellent smell, sight and hearing.

Asian Elephant:Asian Elephant, Elephas Maximus. Elephants, along with rhinos, hippos, occasionally tapirs and other large, thick-skinned mammals, are sometimes referred to as Pachyderms. In some places the skin on an elephant is 1.5 inches thick and their skin makes up about 10% of their body weight. The skin plays a role in regulating body temperature, as do the ears. The ears are full of blood vessels and act as radiators. As the ears are flapped the resulting breeze cools the blood and so helps maintain/lower the body temperature. The ears of the Asian elephant resemble the sub continent of India in shape. The size and shape of the ears is the most noticeable difference between the Asian and African species of elephant. Those of the African elephant are much larger and resemble the continent of Africa.  An elephant uses its trunk for breathing, drinking, eating, communicating, smelling, digging, social interaction, and self defense or defense of its young. The trunk is a combination of the nose and upper lip. An elephant can suck between 1 and 2 gallons of water into its trunk and then squirt it into its mouth for a drink or onto its body for a shower. The complex muscular structure of the trunk provides both strength and great dexterity. The exact number of muscles isn't known, but there are thousands. There are no bones in the trunk. Trunks are also instruments of touch (caressing and disciplining the young), grasping, and social interaction. The end of the trunk has a "finger" projection that helps to pick up small objects.

Black and White Colobus:Black and White Colobus, Colobus angolonsis. The Angolan Colobus is a heavily built, mostly black monkey with long, white hairs on the shoulders and well-developed white whiskers. The white shoulder hairs vary in length between subspecies and give this monkey its alternate name: the White-epauletted Black Colobus. The Angolan Colobus does not have a mantle. The white tail tuft is variable among subspecies.  There are four ways in which the Colobus monkey is unique from other monkeys: 1. Their hind legs are longer and stronger 2. They have vestigial or no thumbs 3. They have compartmentalized stomachs similar to ruminants 4. They have no cheek pouches

They are the perfect shape for diving for cover in the forest; heavily built with short stocky legs, arched backs and forelegs that are shorter than their hind legs. Both males and females have short, straight horns that are often hidden in a dense tuft of hair that grows between the horns. The female�s horns are much shorter than the males, which average six inches.  Black duikers have soft glossy black or brownish-black hair that is longer than most duikers, although this is difficult to see as the hair lies smoothly against the body. Their head is a brownish fawn and the frontal area is a bright chestnut color. The underparts are much lighter than the back and sides. The hair on the neck and shoulders is much shorter than on the back and sides. Their tail is black with some white or rufous hairs and has a tassel. They have long narrow heads, and preorbital facial glands (large scent glands) beneath the eyes that include a series of pores rather than a single opening. Their brain, relative to size, is larger than all of the antelopes. They have a hesitant high stepping or bouncing gait with sharp eyes and a good sense of hearing and smell. Communicate with snorts, bleats, and a snort accompanied by a whistle sound.

Black Rhinoceros:Black Rhinoceros, Diceros Bicornis. Both male and female black rhinos have two horns with the anterior horn typically larger than the posterior horn. The horns are composed of keratin. The most distinguishing characteristic of the black rhino is the prehensile upper lip. The rhino uses its lips almost like fingers to browse on twigs and leaves. Rhinos are monogastric herbivores. In human care they are frequently fed commercial foods developed for domestic livestock.  Despite short, squat legs and a huge, boxy body rhinos are surprisingly nimble. Their normal gait is a fast walk, but when frightened or agitated they will trot or gallop reaching speeds up to 28 miles per hour for short distances. Their eyesight is poor but the senses of hearing and smelling are acute. The funnel shaped ears swivel in all directions to catch sound waves. The olfactory passages in the head take up more space than the brain. Rhinos have three toes on each foot, with the middle digit supporting most of the massive weight.

Black Swan:Black Swan, Cygnus atratus. This is the only black swan. The adults are dark brownish, black with somewhat paler under parts and white flight feathers. The bill is red to orange with a whitish bar and nail; the iris is reddish and the feet and legs are black. The females are smaller and have a less ruffled back. The neck is longer than that of other swans. Food must be available within 3 feet of water surface and obtained by upending in the water.  Although the appearance is very different from the Mute Swan, posture, behavior, feeding methods, taking flight, display and courtship are the same. Black Swans raise their shoulders in anger and hold their greatly ruffled neck more erect, curving the upper part of the neck, close to the head, and pointing the bill downward. The legs set back on the body giving great aquatic efficiency, but on land this produces a clumsy walk. Like the Mute Swan it has the habit of footdrying.

Bonnethead Shark:Bonnethead Shark, Sphrna tiburo (Sphyrnidae family). Related to hammerheads. There are several theories about the head shape. Front of head semicircular in outline. No other hammerhead has front of head in semicircle. It may act as a bow rudder, increasing maneuverability. May aid in finding food due to large number of sensory pores all over the wide head.  Bonnetheads are nonaggressive sharks but will bite if something is perceived as food. Handfed fish, clams, shrimp, and squid, using a pole with a loop on the end so they don't associate the diver with food. Grab prey with sharp front teeth and crush prey with blunt rear teeth.

Bornean Sun Bear:Bornean Sun Bear, Helarctos Malayanus Eurspilus. They have short, sleek black fur with a golden or white colored crescent shape on their chest (from which comes their name) and the same lighter color around their muzzle and eyes. Their fur appears to be adapted to shed rain, mud and debris. Their muzzle is short and the ears are small and very round. Their forehead may appear to be wrinkled similar to a bulldog and they have short bowed legs, which make them look awkward. They stand on their hind legs for a better view and to bluff approaching enemies. The teeth of a sun bear are flatter than those of the other bears and the canines are long enough to protrude between their lips. Their tongue is extraordinarily long to extract insects and honey out of logs and tree cavities. They have large naked soled feet, possibly an adaptation for climbing. Their claws are long, curved and very pointed. Their sense of smell is their most important sense. The Sun Bear's eyesight is good and even at night they can see differences in color.

Cownose Stingray:Cownose Stingray, Rhinoptera bonasus. Cownose rays have a unique feature-long, pointed pectoral fins that separate into two lobes in front of their high domed heads. A crease in the lobes and a notched head create a cownose likeness that gives these rays their name. Cownose rays use their flexible fin lobes to probe the seafloor for prey, like clams. After detecting buried prey, they dig deep depressions in the sand by flapping their pectoral fins and, at the same time, sucking sand through their mouths and out their gill slits. As they forage, large schools of rays can stir up huge clouds of silt over a large area.  The rays' eyes and spiracles, openings above their eyes that allow them to bring in oxygenated water, are on their brown upper bodies, and their mouths are on their white or yellowish underbellies.  The rays have large, flat tooth plates on both jaws that they use to crush hard-shelled prey. The rays spit out crushed shells and eat the soft body parts.

Eastern Hellbender:Eastern Hellbender, Cryptobranchus alleganiensis alleganiensis. The hellbender is a harmless aquatic salamander inhibiting large swiftly flowing streams with rocky bottoms and clean water. According to the Missouri Department of Conservation the name "Hellbender" probably comes from the animal's odd look.  These days the hellbender has more names than places left to live. Hellbender is also called the Allegheny alligator, Mollyhugger, mud cat, devil dog and snot otter.  The hellbender belongs to the suborder Cryptobranchoidea, which is the most primitive of living salamanders.  The hellbender has a slimy, flattened body for moving smoothly through water, with an oar like tail, which helps it walk against the current with very little resistance. Hellbenders are cryptically colored with tawny, brown, or dark gray skin mottled with dark brown or blackish blotches

Florida Manatee:Florida Manatee, Trichecus manatus latirostris. The Florida Manatee is a subspecies of the West Indian Manatee, and is found in southeast United States, primarily in Florida. Closely related to the elephant, manatee fossils found worldwide go back as far as 60 million years. In Florida, 45 million years. Aquatic, warm-blooded, air breathing, herbivorous mammal. Lives in salt, brackish or fresh water. The difference in salinity is processed in its kidneys. The skin is 1 thick, gray to gray/brown in color, with coarse hair mainly around the snout and lips. It can move each side of its lip pads independently. (Polar bear skin is 4 inches thick.) They must come to surface to breathe every 3-5 minutes while active and every 20 minutes when at rest. Seldom dive deeper than 20 feet. Lungs are flattened, elongated and stretch almost to the anus. This shape helps with buoyancy. Rib bones are solid.  Manatees spend 6 to 8 hours per day eating 5 to 10% of their body weight, which means 150 to 250 pounds of plants. They have �marching molars�, which are molar-like teeth replaced continuously and horizontally throughout its life. The closest relative at the zoo is the elephant.

Fly River Turtle:Fly River Turtle, Carettochelys insculpta. The Fly River turtle is also called the pig-nosed turtle and is undoubtedly one of the strangest turtles in the world. Unlike any other freshwater turtle, it possesses flippers resembling those of marine turtles. This turtle gets its descriptive name, "pig-nosed," because its nose actually resembles that of a pig. Its nostrils are located directly in front of the fleshy, protruding snout.  This turtle is gray, with an olive color top and a yellow or white underside. The top of its tail has a single line of scales and because it is mostly aquatic, it has paddle-shaped limbs with two claws on each. The shell is surfaced with skin, not with scales. The male has a larger tail than the female.

Flying Fox Bat:Flying Fox Bat, Pteropus Vampyrus. The name originates from their superficially fox-like heads. The resemblance is further increased by the pricked ears and ruff of fur around the neck. Their eyes are large and, unlike insect-eating bats, they depend on their sight (effective twilight vision) and not echolocation. They also have acute hearing. The female identifies her young by their call. They have a reddish head (becomes deep gold or orange suddenly during breeding season) with a dark muzzle. The back is black with scattered white hairs. The tissue-thin flying membrane, claws, posture, and thumb on each wing puts them in the bat family. Their wingspan, which can be over 6 feet, is longer and broader than insect-eating bats. They can fly more powerfully than other bats. Their wings are also jointed in several places allowing them to wrap them around their body for warmth and protection.

Gila Monster:Gila Monster, Heloderma suspectum. The Gila Monster and the related Mexican Beaded Lizard are the only venomous lizard in the U.S.A.  Venom is not effective as predator defense. It is used only as a part of the digestive system. They have no fangs, but they do have enlarged teeth in the lower jaw that lacerate the victim and enables more and deeper penetration of venom. Human deaths from their bites are extremely rare. The gila monster�s venom glands are located in the bottom of its mouth. All venomous snakes have their venom glands in the tops of their mouths.  Their skin pattern is camouflaging, particularly at the times the animal is active (crepuscular and nocturnal) and in rocky terrain that has vegetation to cast shadows. They spend most of their time hiding underground.  The name Gila is pronounced �heela� and is named for the Gila River area in Arizona and California.

Golden Frog:Golden Frog, Atelopus zeteki. The Panamanian Golden Frog is a small, brightly colored, and is Panama's national animal. Female is larger than the male. The size and weight is also dependant on whether it lives in a dry forest or wet forest region. The dry forest frog is smaller than its wet forest counterpart. The head is longer than broad, with a pointed, protruding nose. The pupil is horizontally elliptical. The skin looks smooth and limbs are slim and long. The Panamanian golden frog is the most toxic species of Atelopus, with the skin of a single individual containing enough toxins to kill 1200 20g mice. Zetekitoxin AB is the major alkaloid in Atelopus zeteki's skin extracts.  Normally the abdomen is also yellow; the female's ventral surface will have a lighter-colored abdomen when carrying eggs. The frog's fingers are long and narrow. The first finger is much shorter than the second with basal webbing between the first and second fingers in the male; the other fingers are free. The toes are extensively webbed with only the forth toe substantially free of webbing.

Golden Mantled Bat:Golden Mantled Bat, Pteropus Pumilus. All bats are mammals in the order Chiroptera, which means "hand wing". They are the only mammals with true flight. Their wings are made up of the bones of their arms and elongated fingers, connected with a skin membrane.  There are approximately 1100 species of bats, divided into two suborders: megachiroptera and microchiroptera. Contrary to what the names imply, the division is not based on the size of the bats. The division is based primarily whether or not the species have the ability to echolocate. The megachiroptera include only Old World Fruit Bats. However, there are species of fruit eating bats in the New World. The microchiroptera have the ability to echolocate and their eyes are small. No bat species are blind; some see quite well. Their ears, mouths and noses are specialized for the hearing and transmission of echolocation vocalizations. Megachiroptera do not have the ability to echolocate. Their eyes are larger and their sight is good, especially at night.  They are in the family Pteropodid, commonly called flying foxes because of their dog or fox like muzzles. The term "flying fox" is not a scientific name and therefore cannot be used reliably to identify specific species of bats.

Indian Crested Porcupine:Indian Crested Porcupine, Hystrix indica. They have a stocky body with short, stout legs and powerful claws for burrowing. They have small eyes and ears, blackish or dark brown fur with blackandwhite quills (spines) on their back and tail. These quills are up to 20 inches in length. In a relaxed porcupine the quills lay relatively flat however when threatened or alarmed they become erect. Each is ornamented with deep brown or black and white rings. The tail is covered with shorted quills that appear white. They are arranged in multiple layers with a layer of shorter, thicker quills beneath the longer, thinner quills on top. The second layer contains longer, hollow cup shaped rattling quills used to alarm potential predators. In the course of one night a porcupine may cover over 9 miles in search of food. They utilize both natural plants and agricultural crops as food sources.  Offspring are born in a nest of leaves, grasses and roots. Their eyes are open and their quills are soft and flexible, but harden within 10 days. They are striped black and white when born. Parents are monogamous usually and both care for the offspring throughout the first year.

Indian Star Tortoise:Indian Star Tortoise, Geochelone elegans. The carapace of the Indian Star Tortoise shell is high domed and gray or brown in color with a radiating star pattern of lighter lines. These lines help to break up the outline of the tortoise and camoflauge it while hiding in dense grass. The carapace of the Star Tortoise may range from smooth to bumpy (called pyramiding). In other tortoise species, pyramided shells are often common in captive individuals and indicate an improper diet or lack of necessary humidity. Many Star Tortoises, however, naturally have pyramided shells. One theory is that the bumps help the Star Tortoise to right itself if it falls over on to its back. The front legs of a Star Tortoise are powerful and heavily scaled. The thick scales provide protection against predators. When threatened, a Star Tortoise tucks its head into its shell and pulls up its limbs. The forelegs prevent the predator from reaching the vunerable head or neck of the tortoise. Star Tortoises are sexually dimorphic (meaning that there are two distinct forms) with females growing much larger than the males.

Moose:Moose, Alces alces. Moose are taller at the shoulder than at their rump. Bulls may weigh up to 1200 pounds and reach 7 feet in height.  They have large hooves for walking on snow and ice. Both the cow and the bull have a throat appendage called a dewlap or bell. Females are be identified by a white vulva patch. Researchers use this for counting females during the winter counts.  Only the bull carries the palmate antler. Antlers are comprised of a calcium-phosphorous base covered with a soft covering (velvet) during the growth period. In July-August the velvet starts to dry, which means the blood supply to maintain growth has ceased. The antlers become hardened (calcified). The velvet is removed by raking across shrubs and branches in late September to mid October. Removal of the velvet coincides with the breeding season (rut). Antlers are shed during the winter. About 2 weeks after antler shedding, re-growth can be seen. Young males will shed antlers their first year. Antlers will continue to grow larger each year until the age of 7. At this time, they will be about the maximum size. This size will be maintained each year thereafter, but may become more palmate.

North American River Otter:North American River Otter, Lontra canadensis. The River otter�s fur is short and dense for ease of swimming. It is usually black, reddish or gray-brown on the back and light or gray-brown on the belly. They rely on their fur and the layer of air trapped by the undercoat to conserve body heat. This provides additional protection from the colder water temperatures and possibly even provides extra floatation. The otter�s neck is long and legs are short, their long slender body with small ears and no hair on the diamond-shaped nose make it easy moving through their environment.

Orangutan:Orangutan, Pongo pygmaeus abelii. Orangutan means "person of the forest". Sumatran orangutans have coarse, long, reddishbrown hair and an arm span of up to 7.5 feet. Both males and females have long beards, however, male orangutans also develop cheek pads, which give appearance of facial disks. They have puffy checks and a hanging throat pouch that contains air sacks that will produce a groaning, bubbling call that can be heard at least a half mile away. Their legs are short and rather weak, but their hands and arms are strong.

Pallas' Cat:Pallas' Cat, Otocolobus Manul. They have stocky bodies with thick soft fur and an abundant dark wooly under-fur, which is double the length of the fur on the rest of the body. This provides a good source of insulation for an animal that spends most of its time laying on frozen ground and snow. The color varies from a light gray to a yellowish buff and russet, with white tips of hair making them appear frosted. This allows them to blend into the color of the steppes. Faint stripes along the sides of the body are more visible in the summer. The fur on the underside is darker. The head is round and broad with scattered black spots on the forehead and two distinct parallel black bars on each cheek. The large owl-like eyes are yellow and the pupils contract into small circles instead of the usual vertical slits. They have well developed nictitating membranes (third eyelid) that give them protection from both the cold winds and the regular dust storms which arise in their home ranges. The legs are short and stout and the tail is thickly furred with a broad terminal black band and 5-6 narrow rings along it. They can wrap their tails around themselves like a warm muff. They look much heavier than they are due to their stocky build and thick coat.

Pancake Tortoise:Pancake Tortoise, Malacochersus tornieri. The Pancake Tortoise is one of the oddest of all tortoises. Unlike other tortoises, which typically have a high domed shell, the carapace of the Pancake Tortoise is flattened. Rarely do they exceed an inch in height. The carapace is typically tan or pale yellow and often has a beautiful pattern of radiating brown lines. The plastron is very thin and flexible with large pliable (soft) areas. In other species of tortoises, the bones that underlie the plastrons of the adults are solid. However, the flexibility of the Pancake Tortoise�s plastron comes from many holes (called fenestrations) in the plastral bones. The plastron is so flexible that it may move in and out as the tortoise breathes. Pancake tortoises have enlarged scales on their forelegs. They have powerful limbs and can move quickly. Mature males have longer and thicker tails than do females.

Rabbitfish:Rabbitfish, Siganidae Family. The family Siganidae contains many perciforms (perchlike species) with the unique trait of having fins that bear two stout spines with three soft rays between them. (Uniquely, the pelvic fins are formed from two spines.) There is a long, single dorsal fin with 13 spines and then 10 soft rays; the anal fin has 7 spines and 9 soft rays. The spiny rays are venomous.  The fish has a long snout-like mouth for feeding on algae and reaching into crevices and teeth compressed into a single row in an asymmetrically bicuspid arrangement.  This family of fish is normally known for its reserved temperament and large eyes. A colorful fish species, but deceiving because color changes with mood, thus making identification sometimes hard. A fright, threat or death makes the fish fade and/or develop dark blotches. Female is slightly larger and less colorful than male.

Red Crowned Crane:Red Crowned Crane, Grus Japonensis. These are the only cranes with white primary feathers. Adult forehead and crown are covered with bare red skin and a large white band that extends from behind the eyes and meets sharply with the black lower neck. Majority of body is white with the exception of black secondary and tertiary feathers. Eyes are black and legs are slate to grayish black. Males and females are virtually indistinguishable, although males tend to be larger. The Red Crowned Crane is the heaviest of the crane species.  Juveniles are a combination of white, partly tawny, cinnamon brown, and/or grayish plumage. The neck collar is grayish to coffee brown, the secondaries are dull black and brown and the crown and forehead are covered with gray and tawny feathers. The legs and bill are similar to those of adults, but lighter in color. The primaries are white, tipped with black, as are the upper primary coverts. At age two the primaries are replaced with all white feathers.

Red Kangaroo:Red Kangaroo, Macropus rufus. The Red Kangaroo is the largest living marsupial and is one of the 55 species that make up the family Macropedidae (Macroped=big foot). When feeding or moving slowly, kangaroos balance themselves on their small forelegs and strong tail, swinging their huge hind feet forward. When traveling fast, only the two hind feet are used with the tail held almost horizontally as a balancer.  They can travel up to 25 mph, making leaps 26 feet long and 5 feet high. A hopping kangaroo is able to keep moving while hardly expending any additional energy. In fact, kangaroos actually burn less energy the faster they hop. Unlike many animals, kangaroos do not rely on perspiration alone to carry away most of their excess body heat. Instead, they stop sweating as soon as they stop hopping and start panting. Kangaroos are the only mammals to switch from sweating to panting as soon as exercise stops.  The male is a boomer, the female a flyer, and the young are joeys. Kangaroos live in groups of a dozen or more called mobs, feeding mainly at night and resting in the heat of the day. The mob has no leader or sentinels. When a kangaroo senses danger, it alerts its cohorts by thumping its feet on the ground.

Reindeer:Reindeer, Rangifer tarandus. Reindeer are sturdy, short-legged animals, having a brownish coat that is dark in the summer and light in the winter. The long hairs under the neck, the fur just above the hooves, and the region about the tail are almost white. As protection against the rigorous climate in which it lives, the reindeer has a heavy coat of woolly under-fur and straight, stiff, tubular guard hairs. When a caribou walks, the clicking noise may be produced by a tendon slipping over a bone in the foot. Its eyesight is poor, its hearing adequate. It depends in large part on the sense of smell to detect food and danger. Reindeer are ruminants, which means having a 4-chambered stomach.  This is the only breed of deer that both males and females grow antlers. The antlers of the male are long, branched, and slightly flattened at the tips: the brow tines are well developed. The antlers of the females are smaller and simpler. Antler growth is from April throughout the summer. They are full grown by July though they do not completely harden until fall. The antlers are covered with velvet which is vascularized, aiding in the growth of the antlers. Male reindeer will drop their antlers in the winter whereas female reindeer retain their antlers until after calving season in the spring.

Southern Stingray:Southern Stingray, Dasyatis americana (Dasyatidae family). Named for the spine on the top of their whiplike tail, which is about 1/3 of the way from the body toward the end of the tail. Used for defense only.  Disk has sharp outer corners and irregular row of short spines on upper surface. Upper surface of disc gray, dark or olivaceaous brown or olive green. Lower surface of disc white or whitish with an edging of gray or brown.  Underside Mouth, nostrils and gill slits. Visitors think this arrangement looks like a face. Respire by drawing water through a small hole behind the eye and expelling it through gill slits on the underside of the disc.  Top Eyes and spiracles, which allow drawing in water for gills while on the bottom or buried in the sand. Position of eyes means they can never see the food. They find their food by sense of touch and their electroreceptive system.

Spinytailed Iguana:Spinytailed Iguana, Ctenosaura similis. Adult Spinytailed Iguanas are tan or light gray with dark bands or chevrons across the body and legs. When young iguanas first hatch out, they are pale graybrown, but turn bright green after a few months. Eventually, this green pigmentation fades into the adult color. Male Spinytailed Iguanas have longer snouts and larger jaw muscles than females. Many males also have crests of large spikes running from the back of the head to the tail. As the common name suggests, the tail of this species is covered in enlarged, spiny scales.

Tang:Tang, Acanthuridae family. Named for 1, 2, or 3 sharp spines at base of tail part of a knife blade that goes into handle is called a "tang" or "sharp". This spine area is typically marked by a bright color to be a warning to potential predators. It is used both offensively and defensively by quickly side swiping the opponent with the tail.  Family includes 72 species of surgeonfish, tangs, and unicornfish and is broken into three subfamilies based on the type of spine. The sub-family Acanthurus has a single retractable spine, that folds into a groove on the side of the fish. The subfamily Nasinae (genus Naso) has one or two fixed, razor sharp plates instead of retractable spines. Genus Prionurus is the only genus in sub-family Prionurianae, which is characterized by 3 to 6 spines.  Surgeonfish are diurnal and mostly herbivorous. Four species of Acathurus and most of Naso feed on zooplankton and Ctyenochaetus on detritus, but most surgeonfish graze on benthic algae and have a long intestine; some feed mainly on zooplankton or detritus. They have a small terminal mouth with a single row of close-set teeth.

Triggerfish:Triggerfish, Balisitidae Family. Triggerfish get their name from the action of their first two dorsal fins. The first fin is erected and locked into place by the second dorsal fin. Depressing the second spine will release the locked first dorsal spine. Triggerfish use this mechanism when they are threatened and when sleeping at night. In both cases, they find caves or crevices with a small opening to wedge themselves in using their "trigger" spines. Triggerfish normally swim by undulating their second dorsal and anal fins, but will use their tail for rapid bursts. Pelvic and ventral fins are usually absent.  The tooth area is highly colored to draw attention. The small mouth contains eight long incisor-like teeth in the first row and six smaller teeth in a second row buttressing the first row. They are capable of rotating eyeballs independently. Most triggerfish are solitary diurnal carnivores. They have 39 to 50 rows of plate-like scales.

Warthog:Warthog, Phacochoerus aethiopicus. The warthog is given its name due to the warts on their head, which as they grow older the warts will become more prominent. These warts are thick and act as protective pads. Tusks can grow to 10 inches long. Two tusks grown from the sides of the snout and the lower two tusks are smaller and worn down to a sharp point. Bristles cover the warthog�s body and longer hairs form at the top of the head and run down along the spine to the middle of the back. The warthog�s tail contains a tuft of hair on the tip.
Western Lowland Gorilla:Western Lowland Gorilla, Gorilla gorilla gorilla. The largest primates, they have dense and muscular bodies. Their arms are long relative to their legs. Their arm-span can be more than 96 inches. Their coat is wiry and varies in color with various shades of brown, black, red and gray. Dentition is the same as man.  As males enter adulthood, around 15 years old, they develop a broad, silvery-white saddle along the back, extending over the rump and thigh as they age. At that point, therefore, the male is called a "silverback". Hair length varies over different parts of the body. Hair on the chest is sparse-to-absent, as is the hair on the center of the face, fingers, toes, and underside of the hands and feet. Their skin is jet black almost from birth.  Compared with the female, the male develops more pronounced jaw muscles that attach to the top of his skull, called the "sagittal crest". The brow bone is pronounced, the ears small and the nostrils are splayed and heavily padded. Females achieve their full size around age 10. Infants born in human care weigh 3.5 to 5.5 pounds at birth (usually smaller in the wild) and are weaned in two to four years.

Western Tufted Deer:Western Tufted Deer, Elaphodus Cephalophus. Similar in appearance to Muntjac but slightly larger. Gets it name from the distinctive tuft of hair seen on the top of its head. This tuft shows up clearly as it is darker in color than the rest of the body. And is blackish-brown. Their coats are short and dense, the hairs being rather spiky and giving the Tufted Deer a shaggy appearance. The color of their coat is a chocolate brown. Under parts are paler in color and a whitish gray. The head and neck are darker gray. They have white markings on the face, the tips of the ears and on the underside of the tail.  These areas stand out well against the dull coloration of the rest of the body. The white face markings sometimes run around the eyes and towards the top of the head. Like most deer they have scent glands in front of their eyes. Found in thick dense forest, mostly in hilly or mountainous areas. Mostly seen around rivers or other sources of water. They are found at altitudes between 985 and 15,100 feet.  Males have simple spiked antlers that grow from short, bony pedestals on the forehead. A more visible characteristic in males is the length of the upper canines, which may grow up to 1� long and protrude from the mouth like fangs.  These deer tear off vegetation to eat by pressing the lower incisors against a callous pad that takes the place of upper incisors.

White Handed Gibbon:White Handed Gibbon, Hylobates lar. The gibbon is the most agile of the mammals and the smallest of the 5 anthropoid apes. The fingers are long and the thumbs appear long because they are deeply cleft from the palms of the hands. Their thumbs are very mobile and they are very adept at manipulating objects. Gibbons are distinguished by their extremely long arms, which may be 1 1/2 times the length of their legs. They live high in the trees using a form of locomotion called brachiation, swinging hand over hand from branch to branch. They can make effortless leaps of 30 feet or more. This agility is mainly due to its long arms, which can move freely in all directions, its light body and the long fingers, which are held in a hooked position with the thumbs out of the way. Babies travel clinging around their mother's waist like a belt and she raises her legs to help support them as she swings through the trees with her arms.  Males and females can either be black or blonde.

Wrasses:Wrasses, Labridae Family. Wrasses are torpedo shaped with several color phases: juvenile, young adult male and female, and terminal (sex reversed) male. Wrasses can change sex in the middle of their life span, based on population needs. All wrasses are carnivores, but diet varies from zooplankton to large invertebrates, which they eat with their protruding canine teeth. They are primarily diurnal and seek shelter for the night in cracks and crevices, although some will bury themselves in the sand and others produce a protective mucus envelope.

Zebra Shark:Zebra Shark, Stegostoma Fasciatum. A sleek and slender shark with distinctive lateral ridges and a very long tail, as long as its body and with a deep notch and lower lobe hardly developed. The adult is yellow brown with dark spots. The juvenile is dark with white bars and spots. The young is black with yellow bars or zebra stripes, hence the name. Because of the change to cheetah-like spots as it matures, the zebra shark is sometimes mistakenly called the leopard shark; however, that is a shark found off the eastern Pacific coast of North America.
